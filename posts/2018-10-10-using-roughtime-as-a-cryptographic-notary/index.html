I wrote a simple tool as a PoC\nRecently, Cloudflare announced that they are now running a roughtime server. Roughtime is a cryptographically secured time-synchronization protocol - think NTP with signatures. For an actual description of how it works, I recommend reading the Cloudflare blog post. But at it’s very core (oversimplification ahead), the user chooses an arbitrary (usually randomly generated) nonce and the server signs it, plus the current time.\nOne thing roughtime adds on top of this, is the ability to build a chain of requests. This is achieved by taking a hash of a response, combining it with a randomly generated “blind” and using the combined hash as a nonce to the next request. The intended use-case of this is that if a server provides the wrong time or otherwise misbehaves, you can obtain cryptographic proof of that fact by getting a timestamped signature of its response from a different server. By storing the initial nonce, generated blinds and responses, the entire chain can be validated later.\nWhen I saw Cloudflares announcement, my first thought was that it should be possible to use a roughtime server as a Time Stamping Authority. The goal is, to obtain a cryptographic proof, that you owned a particular document at the current point in time - for example to ensure you can proof original authorship without publishing the document itself.\nThe simplest way to achieve this using roughtime is to use the SHA512 hash of the file as an initial nonce. That way, the roughtime server signs that hash together with the current time with their private key. By using the roughtime chain protocol, you can get that proof corroborated by multiple servers.\nYou can also think of extending this, to get stronger properties. Using the hash of the file as a nonce only proves that the file existed before that specific point in time. It also doesn’t actually prove that you had the file, but only the hash. This can be remediated though. If we run a regular roughtime request, the resulting response is unpredictable (to us) and signs the current time. Thus, if we use a hash of that response as a prefix “salt” of the file itself, the resulting hash proofs that we knew the file after that chain ran. We can then use that hash as a nonce for another roughtime chain and get a proof that we had the file at a specific point (or rather, a small interval) in time. Furthermore, we can opt to use the file-hash not as the nonce itself, but as a blind. The advantage is, that the blind is never transmitted over the network, so the actual proof is only available to us (if we use it as a nonce, an eavesdropper could intercept the proof). I illustrated these options in a recent talk I gave on the subject.\nThese ideas are mostly academic. I’m not sure how useful these properties are in practice. Nevertheless, the idea intriguiged me enough to implement it in a simple tool. It’s in a pretty rough, proof-of-concept like shape and I don’t know if I will ever progress it from there. It also comes with a client implementation of the roughtime protocol in Go - initially I was not aware that there already was a Go implementation, but that also is not go-gettable. Either way, it was fun to implement it myself :)\n","wordCount":"577","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-10-10T23:22:40Z","dateModified":"2018-10-10T23:22:40Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.merovius.de/posts/2018-10-10-using-roughtime-as-a-cryptographic-notary/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mero's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.merovius.de/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.merovius.de/ accesskey=h title="Mero's Blog (Alt + H)">Mero's Blog</a>
